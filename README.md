## Contents
Given that thousands of publications on coronaviruses have been produced to date, necessitates the use of machine learning, such as principal components analysis (PCA) and topic modeling with latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) â€“ is necessary to quickly identify key topics and knowledge gaps. Thus, we propose a generalizable machine learning framework that may be used to effectively automated identification of knowledge gaps for SARS-CoV-2 and other novel pathogens.<br />
